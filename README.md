###From the developer:

This project is meant to be more an extended proof of concept,
rather than a ready to use application. 
I know, that the code is not too good, to be honest, it is horribleâ€¦ 
This is not due to a lack of will of the developer, 
but more due to a lack of experience and time
(this is my second python program I have ever written). 
There are many places in the code, that are bad 
in terms of performance and software architecture (some of them are even marked in the code, some not). 

I ask the user for understanding and invite him, or her to improve this program, 
add new features and make it more robust and performant.

Enjoy it :)
